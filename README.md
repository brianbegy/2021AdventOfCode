# 2021 Advent of Code

## Let's try it in Python this year

## Q and A

    - Do you know Python?
      - No.  Not really.
        - But this seems like a chance to noodle around in Python a bit.
    - Is this going to be like every year, where you do the first couple and then lose interest?
      - Probably.
